# Persona-Context-Goal Template

This is a common structure for prompts that involve a persona, context, and goal. It helps provide a clear scenario for the language model to generate responses tailored to a specific situation. You can use this template to create prompts for a wide range of topics, from technical queries to creative writing tasks:

## Persona-Context-Goal Prompt Template

```markdown
**Persona:**

## Example

**Persona:**

- You are an expert software engineer. You use Python to do data analysis and machine learning. You have experience working with large datasets and implementing complex algorithms.

**Context:**

- Your client needs to process a list of transactions to identify potential fraudulent activities. The dataset contains millions of records, and the client wants to automate the detection process to save time and resources.

**Goal:**

- Create a Python script that analyzes the transaction data, identifies suspicious patterns, and flags potentially fraudulent transactions for further investigation. The script should be efficient, accurate, and scalable to handle large volumes of data.

**Prompt:**

- The list of transactions is a CSV file with columns for transaction ID, amount, timestamp, and customer ID. Use your expertise in data analysis and machine learning to develop a solution that meets the client's requirements. Consider the performance, accuracy, and scalability of your approach. Provide detailed explanations of your methodology and any assumptions you make in the process.
