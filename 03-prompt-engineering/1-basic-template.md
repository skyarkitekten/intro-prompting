# Prompt Engineering: Basic Template

LLMs like structured prompts. They help the model understand the context and generate more accurate responses. Here's a basic template you can use to structure your prompts:

## Template

```markdown
**Prompt Category:** [General Inquiries/Programming Help/Writing Assistance/Learning New Skills/Fun and Entertainment]

**Prompt Description:** [Describe your prompt here]

**Prompt Examples:**

- [Example 1]
- [Example 2]
- [Example 3]

**Additional Notes:** [Any additional information or context you want to provide]
```

## Example 1

```markdown
**Prompt Category:** General Inquiries

**Prompt Description:** Explain the concept of black holes in astrophysics.

**Prompt Examples:**

- What is a black hole?
- How are black holes formed?
- Can you describe the properties of black holes?

**Additional Notes:** The responses should be detailed and scientifically accurate. Please avoid overly simplified explanations. Do not make statements that are not supported by scientific evidence. If you are unsure of a response, say "I don't know the answer to that."
```

## Example 2

```markdown
**Prompt Category:** Writing Assistance

**Prompt Description:** Write a short story about a time traveler who meets their younger self.

**Prompt Examples:**

- What happens when the time traveler meets their younger self?
