# Few shot learning

Few-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm that aims to train models to recognize new classes or tasks with only a few examples. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where collecting large amounts of labeled data is challenging or expensive. By leveraging transfer learning, meta-learning, and other techniques, few-shot learning algorithms can generalize from a small number of examples to perform well on unseen data.

## Zero-shot Learning Example

```markdown
**Task:** Zero-shot Estimation of Work

**Description:** Given a set of tasks and their corresponding descriptions, the model should estimate the amount of work required to complete each task. The model has not seen any examples of these tasks during training and must rely on its general knowledge and understanding of the task descriptions to make accurate estimates.

**Task:**

- Respond to 10 emails.
- Write a blog post copy to share on LinkedIn about Few-shot Learning.
- Write a business proposal for a new project.
```

## One-shot Learning Example

```markdown
**Task:** One-shot Estimation of Work

**Description:** Given a set of tasks and their corresponding descriptions, the model should estimate the amount of work required to complete each task.

The model has seen one example of a task: it took 10 minutes to respond to 2 emails. The model must use this example to estimate the work required for the other tasks.

**Task:**

- Respond to 10 emails.
- Write a blog post copy to share on LinkedIn about Few-shot Learning.
- Write a business proposal for a new project.
```

## Few-shot Learning Example

```markdown
**Task:** One-shot Estimation of Work

**Description:** Given a set of tasks and their corresponding descriptions, the model should estimate the amount of work required to complete each task.

The model has seen a few examples of this task:

- Respond to 10 emails took 1 hour.
- Write a blog post copy to share on LinkedIn about Few-shot Learning took 4-6 hours.
- Write a business proposal for a new project took 8-12 hours.

**Task:**

- Create a job description for a new role.
```
